This project, to conjugate Italian verbs (small surprise, that, given the history of my
previous posting) is written in Python.

It does invoke some advanced aspects of Python:

> Pattern matching
> lambda functions
> Switch statements
> try/except
> range
> zip
> yield
> generator functions
> abstract class and class inheritance
> __func__ overrides in classes
> shelve file-database interaction

Some functions I could not shoehorn in without looking more ridiculous than I
already appear:

> custom descriptors (class and function)
> custom metaclasses
> static methods
> "module package" imports
> __iter__/__next__ overrides
> slot
> properties
> map(func, args)
> comprehensions

But all "did not do those" aside, we begin with how to use the files.

To start, this is written using features of Python 3.x.  There are no guarantees it will
work under 2.6 or less.

5 files needed, and their uses:

createdb.py

Creates a shelve db file that will create a 3-element database of serialized classes.
The classes are described in "verbdata.py" and the serialized classes are read into
"combined.py" as self-knowing classes.

verbdata.py

Defines class VerbData.  This class is primarily a dictionary of dictionaries.  
Each top-level dictionary key is a "tense" (Present, Future, etc).  The value of
of each dictionary element is a dictionary of form/suffix for the person/count
forms.  For example, present tense of "are" verbs:

I/io      -o
you/tu    -i
he/lui    -a
we/noi    -iamo
you/voi   -ate
theyloro  -ano

There are 7 levels of these sets of 6, and 3 types of verbs ("are", "ire", "ere").
The structure supports this and contains a "conjugate" function in the function
name "printVerb".

combined.py

Opens an input file and shelve database file.  For all verbs in the input file
the verbs will read the appropriate shelve element which reconstitutes all
class characteristics without the need for "import verbdata".  Then the verb will be
conjugated and printed.

verbs.txt

List of verbs.

<dictionary>.db

The dictionary you create with "createdb.py".  Used as input to "combined.py".
